Description: Interacting with binary files can be difficult because R's types
    are a subset of what is generally supported by 'C'.  This package provides a 
    suite of functions for reading and writing binary data (with files, connections, 
    and raw vectors) using 'C' type descriptions.  These functions convert data
    between 'C' types and R types while checking for values outside the 
    type limits, 'NA' values, etc.
